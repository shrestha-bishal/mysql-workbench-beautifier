# MySQL Workbench Beautifier

MySQL Workbench Beautifier is a lightweight, non-intrusive AutoHotkey (AHK) script that enhances the SQL authoring experience in MySQL Workbench by automatically converting SQL keywords to uppercase as you type. The script is designed for developers who prefer consistently styled queries and minimal manual formatting overhead.

### Overview
This script introduces real-time SQL keyword formatting into MySQL Workbench, ensuring immediate, consistent styling without altering your workflow. By capitalizing recognized SQL keywords as you type, it improves query readability, enforces project-wide formatting standards, and reduces post-authoring cleanup. It operates exclusively within MySQL Workbench and requires no modification to the application itself.
